# Ecommerce-Text Classification

## Description
Text documents are like treasure troves of information for businesses. 
They can reveal important trends and influence investment decisions. 
Companies often hire analysts to monitor online marketplaces for these insights. 
However, manually sorting products into categories like "Electronics," 
"Household," "Books," and "Clothing & Accessories" is time-consuming and 
inefficient. 

  To automate this process, you'll create a machine learning 
model to accurately categorize new products.
